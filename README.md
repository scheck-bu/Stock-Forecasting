# Stock-Forecasting

This is a Jupyter Notebook created for exploring the possibility of predicting stock prices using the SARIMAX model.

The notebook first scrapes the Wall Street website for recommended stocks. The Marketstack API is then used to query historic stock prices on the selected stock. Finaly, a SARIMAX model is trained on the data to create a forecast.
